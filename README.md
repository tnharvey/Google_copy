# Google_copy
This is an Odin Project assignment in which I need to create a copy of the Google home page, which will help me learn to build in HTML based on some requirement, and also to use browser dev tools to figure out how pages are built.

If you are interested in this project, take a look at [the Odin Project's page for this.](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
