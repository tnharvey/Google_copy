This is an Odin Project assignment in which I need to create a simple copy of the Google home page, which will helped me learn to build in HTML based on some requirement, and also to use browser dev tools to deconstruct how pages are built.

If you are interested in this project, take a look at [the Odin Project's page for this.](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
